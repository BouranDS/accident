## Installation

You can not install the released version of accident from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` {r echo TRUE}
install.packages("accident")
```
Because this package doesn't exist really. It was created by John Hopkin university in order to evaluate the programming skill of student who attend to R package course.
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` {r eval = FALSE}
library(accident)
databasename <- make_filename(2013)
print(databasename)
## basic example code
```
## see the vignette for more detail
Accident package contains more complex functions which allow to make deep analysis of
data and produce handy maps with accident statistics. These functions are detailled in 
vignette page of the page.
